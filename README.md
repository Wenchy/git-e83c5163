# git-e83c5163
It is not always easy for new developers to find their way through Gitâ€™s source code.  
A good place to start is with the contents of the initial commit (by Linus Torvalds), with:

```
$ git checkout e83c5163
```

The initial revision lays the foundation for almost everything git has today, but is small enough to read in one sitting.
